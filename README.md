# Alarms Plus
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeoon.alarmsplus "Link to App")

The goal if this project is create a mobile application with the ability to create alarms with additional options.

I often find that having multiple alarms set on my phone helps me sleep if I have something important the next day.

I feel a bit scared that I will sleep past my first alarm, or turn it off then go back to sleep immediately, as it is too easy to turn off alarms.

This app will make disabling an alarm more difficult to prevent this.
